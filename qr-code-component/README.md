## My process

This is my second Frontend Mentor challenge using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. As usual, I started it running <code>npx create-react-app --template TypeScript </code>. I ended up making another array, however, this time I added more characters (5) compared to the amount of products from the previous challenge (3). I struggled to incorporate a prev/next button on the first challenge, however, I spent additional time reading the documentation, Stack Overflow, and Reddit to eventually figured it out.

### Built with

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Mobile-First Approach

### What I learned

I continued to apply the concepts of React and gain additional experience writing functional components. The small victory in this project is as mentioned in the "my process" section, I solved the problem that I struggled with last challenge and managed to incorporate a button prev/next button. This was also the biggest gain for myself as I have a strong grasp on how to use useState and pass down information.

### Continued development

Of course, I still need to continue learning about useState, props, and eventually useEffect for API calls. Additionally, I need to keep using TypeScript in my projects as the errors that it throws has been great in learning it. Finally, I want to keep using Tailwind CSS, however, start messing with customizing the parameters.
