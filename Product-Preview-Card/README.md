## My process

This is my first React.js project outside of a Udemy course and I started it running <code>npx create-react-app --template TypeScript </code>. To practice rendering components on the app.tsx file, I made a card component that contains the project. Afterwards, I made an array that contains all the products in a separate file and passed it into the card component and populated it. Finally, I added prev/next buttons that cycle between the first and second item in the array. However, I couldn't figure out how to set it up in a way that allowed me to cycle through all items with each click.

### Built with

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Mobile-First Approach

### What I learned

I had the opportunity to apply a lot of concepts that I'm learning from the Rect course I'm taking on Udemy in a non-course environment. Just in my attempt on implementing the buttons in my desired function I read through a ton of Stack Overflow, React Docs, and Reddit. I learned a lot more about useState and props. Additionally, by using TypeScript I was able to practice proper function implementation

### Continued development

I need to continue learning about useState and props and how to properly apply them from parent to children. I decided that I took long enough on this first challenge and didn't want to hold myself up on just that when I can continue to practice it in other challenges.
