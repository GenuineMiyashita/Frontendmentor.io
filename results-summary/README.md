## My process

This is my fifth Frontend Mentor challenge using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. As usual, I started it running <code>npx create-react-app --template TypeScript </code>. For this challenge, I aimed to be a little more "complex" and start working with multiple components, usually, it's only a card component. This time, I added a button and a list component in preparation for harder challenges that work with multiple components.

### Built with

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Mobile-First Approach

### What I learned

As usual, my experience with React, Tailwind, and TypeScript continue to increase with each project/challenge I tackle. With this solution, I figured the list of different character attributes was a good opportunity to work with a list element and populate it through the .map(). It took me a while to sort out the individual buttons for each attribute and I still feel as if it could of been done better.

### Continued development

Same as usual, I want to continue development on React, Tailwind, and TypeScript. I'm going to start tackling larger challenges on Frontend that will provide more in-depth practice that you only experience with more complex projects.
