## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

This is my fifth Frontend Mentor challenge using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. As usual, I started it running <code>npx create-react-app --template TypeScript </code>. For this challenge, I aimed to be a little more "complex" and start working with multiple components, usually, it's only a card component. This time, I added a button and a list component in preparation for harder challenges that work with multiple components.

### Built with

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Mobile-First Approach

### What I learned

As usual, my experience with React, Tailwind, and TypeScript continue to increase with each project/challenge I tackle. With this solution, I figured the list of different character attributes was a good opportunity to work with a list element and populate it through the .map(). It took me a while to sort out the individual buttons for each attribute and I still feel as if it could of been done better.

### Continued development

Same as usual, I want to continue development on React, Tailwind, and TypeScript. I'm going to start tackling larger challenges on Frontend that will provide more in-depth practice that you only experience with more complex projects.
