## My process

This is my fourth Frontend Mentor challenge using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. As usual, I started it running <code>npx create-react-app --template TypeScript </code>. For this challenge, I figured it was a perfect opportunity to work with modals to display the information. The concept was to resemble when you're picking a class or an advanced class in a game.

### Built with

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Mobile-First Approach

### What I learned

As usual, my experience with React, Tailwind, and TypeScript continue to increase with each project/challenge I tackle. I learned how to work with modals, broke it into components to gain extra practice, plus I learned how to work with background images in React.

### Continued development

Same as usual, I want to continue development on React, Tailwind, and TypeScript.
