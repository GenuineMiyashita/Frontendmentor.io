## My process

This is my third Frontend Mentor challenge using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. As usual, I started it running <code>npx create-react-app --template TypeScript </code>. This time, I kept it simple, but still aligned with my goal of adding some form of interaction on each project if it doesn't already include it. This time, with a music order summary, I wanted to be able to click the hero image and play audio!

### Built with

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Mobile-First Approach

### What I learned

As usual, my experience with React, Tailwind, and TypeScript continue to increase with each project/challenge I tackle. This time, I didn't know that TypeScript natively doesn't allow audio files to be imported and I had to declare it as a module. Afterwards, I was able to learn and practice on setting up an audio file in React.

### Continued development

Same as usual, I want to continue development on React, Tailwind, and TypeScript. However, I'm probably going to pivot and immediately start tackling the junior level challenges once I finish recreating at least five of my old challenges in React.
